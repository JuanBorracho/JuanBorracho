ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m John! 

Thanks for stopping by my Github.

I'm a junior developer and Northcoders graduate based in Leeds, UK currently looking for my first role in tech.

My main interests are front end development and design. 

I have been learning React as a front end framework along with Sass. I would love to find a role where I can build on these skills.
