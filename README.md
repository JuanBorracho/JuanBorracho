ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m John! 

Thanks for stopping by my Github.

I'm a junior frontend developer currently working in house at Home and Maker, Leeds.

In my current role I am re-designing a website using Figma and then translating these designs into code using Bootstrap 5 and SASS.

In my own time I am teaching myself Tailwind CSS and I plan to learn more about GSAP, page transitions and web animations.
